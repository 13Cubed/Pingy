# Pingy

Pingy is a free ping (ICMP echo request/reply) utility with a clean interface and no ads. It's designed to be a lightweight, quick, and easy to use utility to check for basic network connectivity. It calculates sent/received counts, packet loss, and minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation statistics for round trip time. It also features a ping sound option that will allow you to hear when a ping is successfully received.
